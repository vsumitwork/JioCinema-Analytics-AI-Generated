# Jio Cinema User Analysis Dashboard 🎬

## 🚀 The Future of AI: Moving Towards Agentic Intelligence

AI is evolving beyond simple automation. With advancements in **Agentic AI**, tools like **Replit Agent** can autonomously generate entire projects with minimal human intervention. As **Jensen Huang** (CEO of NVIDIA) emphasized, AI is transitioning from "copilots" to "autonomous agents" that understand context, make decisions, and generate solutions independently.

This project is a step towards that vision — it was entirely built by **Replit Agent**, demonstrating how AI can create fully functional applications from scratch.

**Dataset File:** `jio_cinema_users_extended.csv`

## 🚀 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vsumitwork/JioCinema-Analytics-AI-Generated.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd JioCinemaAnalytics
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
   When you run this command, the URL displayed may look like this:
